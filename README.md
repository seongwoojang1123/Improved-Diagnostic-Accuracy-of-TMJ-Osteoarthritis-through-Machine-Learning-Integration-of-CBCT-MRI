"Improved Diagnostic Accuracy of TMJ Osteoarthritis through Machine Learning Integration of CBCT and MRI"
by Yeon-Hee Lee, Seongwoo Jang, Seonggwang Jeon, Qâ€“Schick Auh, and Akhilanand Chaurasia.

The repository includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization modules for the diagnosis of temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ OA).

This work primarily leverages CNN-based deep learning approaches (VGG16, Fine-Tuning strategies, and Ensemble methods) applied to CBCT and MRI imaging data. The study explores how multimodal integration of imaging modalities can enhance diagnostic performance compared to single-modality approaches.
